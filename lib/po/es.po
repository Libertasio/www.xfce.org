The panel has been rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention in its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known as libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."

It is also possible to get to such a page by going to the <a href=\"https://translations.xfce.org/languages/\">language page</a> first and picking up your language than a collection. The collection &quot;Xfce&quot; has several components for the different stable versions (<em>xfce-4.4</em>, <em>xfce-4.6</em>, etc) and one for the development branch (<em>master</em>). The other collections, for example Applications, have usually only development components as they aren't part of any official Xfce releases."
