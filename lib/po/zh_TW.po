"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "
"environment and hopefully succeeds in fulfilling a number of long time "
"requests. Among the most notable updates is that we have ported the entire "
"Xfce core (Thunar, xfdesktop and thunar-volman in particular) from ThunarVFS "
"to GIO, bringing remote filesystems to the Xfce desktop. The panel has been "
"rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved "
"multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention in "
"its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known as "
"libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a "
"third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our "
"core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly "
"introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."

"Perhaps the most important achievement we will accomplish with Xfce 4.8 is "
"that, despite suffering from the small size of the development team from "
"time to time, the core of the desktop environment has been aligned with "
"today's desktop technologies such as GIO, ConsoleKit, PolicyKit, udev and "
