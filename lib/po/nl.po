"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "
"environment and hopefully succeeds in fulfilling a number of long time "
"requests. Among the most notable updates is that we have ported the entire "
"Xfce core (Thunar, xfdesktop and thunar-volman in particular) from ThunarVFS"
" to GIO, bringing remote filesystems to the Xfce desktop. The panel has been"
" rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved"
" multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention "
"in its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known "
"as libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a"
" third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our "
"core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly "
"introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."
