"reworked settings dialog with categories and pluggable dialogs enabled by "
"default. Basic Synaptics and Wacom settings in the Mouse settings and a new "
"MIME-Type editor. Thunar gained a more polished layout to reduce space usage"
" and more responsive interaction with the thumbnail generator. Because we "
"have not decided on how to merge the desktop functionality into Thunar yet, "
"Xfdesktop has instead received various improvements, including single-click "
"support, desktop icon thumbnails and better pasting of files. The Session "
"Manager has improved power management code, tips have been removed and "
