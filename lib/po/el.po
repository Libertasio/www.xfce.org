"Xfdesktop has instead received various improvements, including single-click "
"support, desktop icon thumbnails and better pasting of files. The Session "

"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "
"environment and hopefully succeeds in fulfilling a number of long time "
"requests. Among the most notable updates is that we have ported the entire "
"Xfce core (Thunar, xfdesktop and thunar-volman in particular) from ThunarVFS "
"to GIO, bringing remote filesystems to the Xfce desktop. The panel has been "
"rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved "
"multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention in "
"its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known as "
"libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a "
"third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our "
"core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly "
"introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."
msgstr ""
"Σε αυτήν την έκδοση έγιναν εκτεταμένες αλλαγές στον πυρήνα του περιβάλλοντος "
"εργασίας Xfce και με αυτόν τον τρόπο υλοποιούμε χαρακτηριστικά που έχουν "
"ζητηθεί εδώ και πολύ καιρό. Μεταξύ των πιο αξιοσημείωτων αλλαγών είναι η "
"μεταφορά ολόκληρου του πυρήνα του Xfce  (συγκεκριμένα των Thunar, xfdesktop "
"και thunar-volman) από το ThunarVFS στο GIO, φέρνοντας τη χρήση των "
"απομακρυσμένων συστημάτων αρχείων στο περιβάλλον εργασίας Xfce. Το ταμπλό "
"ξαναφράφτηκε από το μηδέν και πλέον παρέχει καλύτερη διαχείριση εκτέλεσης "
"εφαρμογών και υποστήριξη multi-head. Η λίστα των νέων χαρακτηριστικών του "
"ταμπλό είναι πολύ μεγάλη για να αναφερθεί εδώ. Χάρη στη νέα βιβλιοθήκη μενού "
"garcon (που ήταν γνωστή ως libxfce4menu, αλλά ξαναγράφτηκε για μία ακόμη "
"φορά), είναι δυνατή η υποστήριξη της επεξεργασίας των μενού μέσω ενός "
"εξωτερικού επεξεργαστή όπως το Alacarte (δεν παρέχουμε κάποιον δικό μας "
"ακόμα). Τέλος, οι βασικές μας βιβλιοθήκες ενημερώθηκαν, με χαρακτηριστικό "
"παράδειγμα την νεοπαρουσιαζόμενη libxfce4ui, η οποία πρόκειται να "
"αντικαταστήσει την libxfcegui4."
