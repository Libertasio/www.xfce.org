<h3>Where do I get it?</h3>
<p>Source tarballs and rpm packages are available. For download locations visit
<a href="http://www.xfce.org/en/download.html">http://www.xfce.org/en/download.html</a> .</p>
<h3>Installation instructions</h3>
<p>RPM packages for redhat 8 and 9 are provided with the release. Debian packages
should be available soon for 'unstable'.</p>
<p>If you can't find binaries for your OS or distribution, or if you would rather
compile the packages yourself, read the instructions below.</p>

<p>Build order</p>
<ul>
<li>libxfce4util</li>
<li>libxfce4mcs</li>
<li>libxfcegui4</li>
<li>desktop modules (see 'Packages')</li>
<li>extras modules (see 'Packages')</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a package should be a simple matter of unpacking the tarball and, from</p>
<dl>

<dt>the top source directory, typing</dt>
<dd><pre>
./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Building XFce 4 depends on pkg-config, GTK+ &gt;= 2.0.6 (including dev packages),
libxml2 and, for xffm, on libdbh (&gt;= 1.0_12), which is available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dbh/"><u>SourceForge</u></a>.</p>

<p>Optionally you can install librsvg 2 &gt;= 2.2, for SVG icon support, and
libstartup-notification, to have a busy cursor when loading applications that
support this standard.</p>
<p>If you install into a different prefix from pkg-config, you have to set the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to include the path to the *.pc files installed by</p>
<dl>
<dt>the XFce 4 libraries, which is ${prefix}/lib/pkgconfig. For example</dt>
<dd><pre>
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All source tarballs contain so called spec files that allow you to build your</p>
<dl>
<dt>own RPM packages</dt>

<dd><pre>
rpmbuild -ta module.tar.gz</pre>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>How do I use it?</h3>
<p>To start an XFce 4 session run 'startxfce4' from the console, instead of
startx. To customize the behaviour of startxfce4 you can copy the xinitrc file
from ${sysconfdir}/xfce4/xinitrc to /.xfce4/xinitrc, make it executable and
edit that file.</p>
<p>The xfce-utils package also provides a script for gdm, which will be installed
if gdm is found during the configure stage. Consult the gdm, kdm or xdm
documentation for pointers on how to add a custom session to your graphical
login manager. It generally should work to create an /.xsession file and put
startxfce4 in there; then you should be able to choose the default session
from the login manager. The /.xsession file must also be executable.</p>
<p>For more information read the XFce 4 documentation, starting with the user
guide. To access the documentation you can run 'xfhelp4', choose help from the
desktop background mouse menu or the rightclick menu on the panel move
handles.</p>
