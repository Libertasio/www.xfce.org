WEBSITE TODO:
    * Create a Xfce tour.
    * Handle images on the website: Gallery? Re-size? Align?
    * Update documentation for the 4.4 release and write new docs for some of the projects.
    * Think about a news system:
        * Each project has it's own news items and 1 for releases/Xfce news, front page shows the latest news items from all of them 
        * Only news on the front page. (Easiest :-))
    * Create a larger "about Xfce" page
    * System to make new release posts easier. (News, new release, files, mirrors combined).
    * Create scripts for frontpage
        * Read Latest blog items
        * Read news (see earlier item)
        * Projects list (random, most visited, static)
        * Shortcuts (see item in "server side")
    * Create a search-bot-friendly website.
    * Opera navigation?
    * Xfce Banner, Logo.

OTHER TODO:
    * Update Bugtracker, Wiki and maybe forum to match website design.

OTHER VERSIONS:
    * http://www.loculus.nl/xfce/new.xfce.org/
    * http://www.loculus.nl/xfce/nick.xfce.org/
    
IDEAS:
    * Make navigation and content navigation one (color, no space whatever). 
    
SERVER SIDE:
    * Track page visits, so the shortcuts on the front page are to most used pages.
    * Rewrite htaccess forwards to match old website

CHECKED BROWSERS:
    * Internet Explorer 6
    * Firefox 1.5 / 1.8 (Windows, Linux)
    * Opera 5 (Windows, Linux)
    * Konqueror 3.5

=========

CONTENT:
    * differentiate between "release notes" and "ChangeLogs"
