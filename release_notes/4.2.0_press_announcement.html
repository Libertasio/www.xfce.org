      <b>Siegen, Germany -- January 16, 2005 --</b>
      Today the Xfce Team announced the release of version 4.2.0 of the
      Xfce Desktop Environment and Development Framework for Unix and
      Unix-like platforms. Xfce 4.2 adds several new applications, support

    <p align="justify">
      Xfce 4.2 consists of a number of components that together provide the
      full functionality of the desktop environment. They are packaged
      separately and users can pick and choose from the available packages to
      create the best personal working environment. Xfce 4.2 includes some
      new applications, like a session manager, an application finder and a
      menu editor, and comes with a new and beautiful icon theme, which
      complies with the freedesktop.org icon theme standard. The existing
      applications have been improved in the areas of functionality, usability
      and interoperability with other applications and desktop environments.
      In addition to that, Xfce 4.2 supports bleeding edge features like the
      new X.org Composite extension and related extensions, which enables
      you to use real transparency for the windows on your desktop. To obtain
      the best possible user experience, Xfce 4.2 includes several new themes
      for a perfect, unified working environment.

      With the ever increasing popularity of the Xfce desktop environment,
      people have started to write third-party applications that enhance the
      basic desktop functionality provided by Xfce. Besides the various
      additional panel plugins available from the Xfce Goodies project,
      there are currently two applications available, that were developed
      with focus on Xfce. These applications are <a href="http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfmedia/">Xfmedia</a>, which
      is a lightweight media player with a nice and intuitive user interface,
      and <a href="http://terminal.os-cillation.com/">Terminal</a>, which is 
      a lightweight and easy-to-use terminal emulator for Xfce.
