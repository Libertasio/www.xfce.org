with ssh'ing on xfce.org server.

Many changes :

  xfce4-systemload, with a short new sentence at the top of the page;
  Chinese translation needed.

  translations needed in all languages.

  not only in the menu. Please Allen, check them since it's copy/paste.

- Reworked credits list; chinese translation of "Website created and 
  maintained by" sentence needed (added on Jasper request ;)).

- New item in the FAQ, documentations pages. Please translate.
- xfce4-iconbox was moved from "overview" page to "extras" page, 
  its place in the packages list in the documentation page was changed, 
  and I've removed the iconbox from the features list. No translation 
  needed BUT please, Allen, remove the iconbox item from the features 
  list in the Chinese overview page.

20030708
- I've added an announcement for xfce4-session (news and index pages) 
  (chinese translation needed)

  some extras packages are under development and could only be available 
  in CVS or from a given url. (chinese translation needed)

20030704
- I've replaced the "vbeta1" useless mark on all index_xx.html with a 
  simple "xfce.org" link. It's aimed to allow easy link to english front 
  page when you find a page that is not in your language from a search engine
- I've added BETA2 FreeBSD port link in download page
- I've added Allen Chen to credits list

20030703

  soon xfce4-iconbox that will move here) > new "applications" item menu 
  on this page >> translations needed

- Riccardo Persichetti, Ejvend Nielsen, Mickaël Graf on the credits page in

	  official one >> do not translate !

  while adding BETA2 ones.

20030619
- New item for the FAQ (xffm related).

- I've added some links in *download page* for the JonAn's modified Garnome 
  and for James Earl's  other BSD port AND Mandrake 9,1 rpm (translations 
  needed in chinese; you're not in a   hurry since those links will die when 
  BETA2 will be out, and xfce.org is really not up to date).

- up-to-date french translation is online

- I've finally added a new "extras" page. That's more logical with current XFce 4 CVS archive tree.
Now previews of gtk2-themes provided by gtk-xfce-engine-2 are availble.
- I've introduced a workaround in the html code of the fast navigation menu because 
of a bug in Opera 7.

20030522

- New screenshots trying to show XFce 4 features.
- New contributed screenshot.

20030514
- new CSS stylesheet to allow html code to be a bit lighter
(but some usage limitations because of 4,X generation browsers readability)
Please test, especially if you are lucky enough to have IE ;-p cause I don't.
I've tested with Moz 1, Moz 1.2.1, Ns 4.7 (beurk, but readable), Konq 2.2.2 
and konq 3.1, Opera 6.11.
- new menu based on a list so it looks the same with all tested browsers 
(excepted... Ns 4.7 :-| : it does not know anything about what a margin is)
- new names for "overview" sub-menu items; it seems clearer like this?
- news updated from B.Meurer's page
- "known to compile on x platforms" future list has now his place in the 
requirements section
- preview for all xfwm4 themes (excepted the last introduced) is now avaible 
on one page for the moment; please test loading time with RTC since I 
got DSL
- new screenshots menu : simplified
- xfce4 roadmap has been added on the "development" page
- links page is now avaible : please tell me about adding/delete 
links cause I've choose those by myself
- french translated part of the website is currently broken
I think current layout (CSS, menu items, number of pages...) is almost final, 
tell me if you do not agree with that.
Work is now needed to modify content : I think it has to be ready for XFce4-beta1.
