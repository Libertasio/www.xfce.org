<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
Xfce is made possible thanks to the help of volunteers with all kinds
of skills and talents. Coding is just one way to help &ndash;
translators, documenters, and designers are also welcome!
This page outlines some of the areas where you could help out.
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/development/devel.png);">Xfce core</h3>

<p>
Feel free to join us in developing the next release of Xfce or in helping fix bugs in existing releases.
<a href="http://bugzilla.xfce.org">Bugzilla</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.8/schedule">roadmap</a>
are good sources of ideas on what needs some love.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in more details or news about current development efforts, subscribe to the
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev">development mailing list</a>.
The <a href="http://wiki.xfce.org/">wiki</a> also contains a lot of useful information.
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/development/goodies.png);">Goodies</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://goodies.xfce.org">Xfce goodies</a> are independent projects related to the
Xfce desktop. Though they are not part of the official release, they complement
and enhance the overall desktop, and they also need your help!
If you want to contribute to one of these, contact that project's maintainer,
or you could start your own pet project.
The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/goodies-dev/">Goodies development mailing list</a>
is there for you if you have any questions.
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/development/i18n.png);">Translations</h3>

<p>
Xfce is translated into dozens of languages. Translations are currently managed using
<a href="https://translations.xfce.org/">Transifex</a>,
and the <a href="https://translations.xfce.org/help/">help page</a> contains instructions on how to contribute.
If you have any questions, the
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce-i18n/">Xfce i18n mailing list</a>
is there for you!
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/development/docs.png);">Documentation</h3>

<p>
As you may have noticed, the <a href="/documentation/">Xfce documentation</a> needs some love!
If you want to join the new documentation effort, please contact us using the
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev">development mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/development/artwork.png);">Artwork</h3>

<p>
The <a href="/about/artwork">Xfce Artwork</a> project needs volunteers! Design new icons,
wallpapers, or window manager themes by following our
step-by-step example <a href="http://wiki.xfce.org/howto">howto's</a>. Or see how others
have customized their Xfce desktops on <a href="http://www.xfce-look.org/">Xfce Look</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="dev" style="background-image: url(/images/projects/library.png);">Xfce framework</h3>

<p>
Xfce provides a framework for developing applications that integrate well in the Xfce desktop environment. This
framework also provides common and useful functionality not present in the GLib/GTK stack, further easing
application development.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://foo-projects.org/%7Ebenny/projects/xfce4-dev-tools/">Xfce developer tools</a>
provide a collection of scripts and M4 macros that are required to build the Xfce core desktop components.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/projects/libraries/">base libraries of Xfce</a> are used by almost
every Xfce application. Among other things, they provide convenience functions and specialized display widgets.
</p>

<p>
While the core Xfce libraries are targeted at desktop development, <a href="/projects/exo/">exo</a>
is targeted at application development. It provides custom widgets, a job framework, and a lot of
other useful functionality for developing applications.
</p>

<p>
Xfce also includes <a href="http://pyxfce.xfce.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfce4-perl">Perl</a>, and
<a href="http://xfc.xfce.org/">C++</a> bindings to its libraries.
