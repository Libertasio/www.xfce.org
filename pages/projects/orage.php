<h2>Orage</h2>

<p>
Orage provides a calendar which integrates nicely into the Xfce Desktop Environment. It is highly configurable and
supports alerts based on dates. It warns you with popup or audio alarm. As it is an application for every day use
it launches itself in the background as a daemon and can be accessed using the Orage Clock plugin for the panel.
