<p>
The Xfce Panel supports multiple panels, with many options for their
position, appearance, transparency and behavior. There are many items 
available by default to customize your panels, like application launchers with 
detachable menus, a graphical pager, a tasklist, a clock, a system tray, 
a show/hide desktop switcher, and even more. It offers an easy way to add 
items using a dialog, and to move items accross different panels. It's 
compatible with the numerous panel plugins available from the 
<a href="http://goodies.xfce.org/">Xfce Goodies</a> project.
