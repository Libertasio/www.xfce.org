<h2>Thunar File Manager</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/projects/screenshots/thunar.png" alt="Thunar" /></p>

<p>
Thunar is a new modern file manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. It has been designed from the ground up to be 
fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and does not include any confusing or useless 
options. Thunar is fast and responsive with a good start up time and directory load time.
</p>

<p>
Thunar implements the various FreeDesktop.org standards to integrate nicely into todays UNIX/Linux desktop world. 
That means that you donâ€™t need to setup your system in a special way or spend hours configuring the file manager, 
instead, it will just work if your system complies with the FreeDesktop.org standards.
