<h2>Window Manager</h2>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/projects/screenshots/xfwm4.png" alt="Window Manager" /></p>

<p>
  The Xfce window manager manages the placement of application
  windows on the screen, provides beautiful window decorations, manages 
  workspaces or virtual desktops and natively supports multiscreen 
  mode. It provides its own compositing manager (from the X.Org Composite 
  extension) for true transparency and shadows. The Xfce window manager 
  also includes a keyboard shorcuts editor for user specific commands and basic
  windows manipulations and provides a preferences dialog for advanced tweaks.
