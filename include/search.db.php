How is Xfce pronounced and what does it mean? What does the logo symbolize? On what platforms does Xfce currently run?Installation How do I installate Xfce? What is the use startup notification option? If you select this option, the window-manager will show an hourglass while the program is loading. The startup-notification libraries have to be installed. They are probably available with your distibution. This feature is only supported by modern applications (Gtk2.x and Qt3.x based). Please note that the API is not yet frozen, and therefore Xfce 4 is only garantied to work with the startup-notification library version >= 0.5. The graphical installer fails with C++ preprocessor fails sanity check The graphical installer fails with Unable to connect to Xserver Is it possible to use Xfce with DM's? Is it possible to start Xfce when I manual login?Usage How do I start Xfce. I want to use Xfce in a corporate environment and don't let users to modify their menu. Use kiosk mode (see panel and xfce4-session docs). How do I display a list of all windows? How do I disable the taskbar in Xfce 4.2? When I start Xfce a dialog pops up saying Could not look up internet address for ... How do I get numlock to start on login? Is it possible to use Media keys in the Shortcut Editor? I'm unable to shutdown or restart my computer when running Xfce. The left-click to get the menu on the title bar menu button seems a little slow. How do I change that? The left-button single-click menu button display speed is linked to the double click speed. If one wants the menu to appear quicker, just change the double click speed in the Xfce 4 Settings Manager Mouse properties to be faster. Or, one can right click on the title bar to get the menu displayed almost instantly without adjusting the double-click speed. The menu will display both ways.Visual Appearance How do I set the panel layer in Xfce 4.2 and 4.4? How do I enable panel transparency and windows shadows? The Xfce Desktop doesn't has any shortcut icons, why? The gtk-xfce-engine themes do not appear in the user interface settings dialog The gtk-xfce-engine-2 package has to be installed using same prefix as Gtk2 itself. When installed from sources, the engine is, by default, installed in /usr/local, while Gtk2 is often installed in /usr. Just install gtk-xfce-engine-2 again using ./configure --prefix=/usr, and the themes will hopefully become available. Is it possible to change the icon used by the iconbox or taskbar for a given application? It's not possible. This setting has to be managed by the application itself. I've installed a plugin for the panel, but the indicators don't use different colors. What can I do? First, try another Gtk theme, since some themes override the color. If it doesn't solve the problem, you probably have an old ~/.gtkrc-2.0 : remove it and try again.Development How can I report bugs? Your can report bugs here or ask on the mailing lists or forums for help. How often are new releases made?"),
