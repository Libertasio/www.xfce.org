<h2><a name="xfce4-intro" id="xfce4-intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>XFce is a lightweight desktop environment for unix-like
operating systems. It aims to be fast and lightweight, while
still being visually appealing and easy to use.</p>

<p>XFce 4 is a complete rewrite of the previous version. It's
based on the GTK+ toolkit version 2. XFce 4 has a radically
different architecture from XFce 3. It embodies the traditional
UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. All of XFce 4's
core components have been written from scratch in order to fit
into the new architecture.</p>

<p>Another priority of XFce 4 is adhereance to standards,
specifically those defined at <a href=
"http://www.freedesktop.org" target="_top">freedesktop.org</a>.
This allows XFce 4 to seamlessly interoperate with programs
written for other desktop environments, if those programs follow
the specified standards.</p>

<p>XFce 4 consists of a number of components that together
provide the full functionality of the desktop environment. They
are packaged separately and you can pick and choose from the
available packages to create the best personal working
environment.</p>

<p>XFce is all free software. The separate components are
released under either the BSD license, the GNU LGPL or the GNU
GPL (see <a href="xfce4-copyright" title=
"Copyright and Licences">the section called &ldquo;Copyright and
Licences&rdquo;</a> for details).</p>
