<h1>Xfce 4.4 Tour</h1>
<p>Xfce 4.4 contains a lot of new features since the last major release.
This page will show the a list of most important changes in Xfce 4.4. It will not
include <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org" target="_blank">Thunar</a>.</p>

<h2>Desktop Icons</h2>
<p>One of the most often requested features during the Xfce 4.0/4.2 days was support for desktop icons. Xfce 4.4 finally includes support for icons on the desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

		</a>
	</div>
</p>
<p>Xfdesktop utilizes Thunar's libraries to handle application launchers and files/folders on the desktop, and it is also able to display icons for minimized windows on the desktop (a popular CDE feature), or to disable desktop icons all together.</p>

<h2>Mousepad</h2>
<p>Mousepad, a simple and lightweight text editor, was included as part of Xfce 4.4. Mousepad starts up very fast and provides all the basic text editing features, which makes it a perfect default editor for Xfce.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 320px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

		</a>
	</div>
</p>

<h2>Orage</h2>
<p>Orage, the new calendar application based on xfcalendar, provides all the features one would expect from a time management application today, while it remains lightweight and easy to use.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 320px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
		<a href="/images/about/tour/orage.png">

		</a>
	</div>
</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>The Xfce Panel was completely rewritten for 4.4, and supports multiple panels and external plugins (running as separate applications and thereby improving the stability of the panel). xftaskbar4 and xfce4-iconbox were dropped from the release, as their functionality is completely provided by the new panel now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 189px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
		<a href="/images/about/tour/panel-properties.png">
			<img src="/images/about/tour/panel-properties-thumb.png" border="0" />
		</a>
	</div>
</p>
<p>The panel items can now be added and reordered using Drag'n'Drop, and the panel launcher properties dialog was redesigned to make it easier to create and manage launchers with attached menus (there is also support for Zero Install now).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 320px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
		<a href="/images/about/tour/panel-launcher.png">
			<img src="/images/about/tour/panel-launcher-thumb.png" border="0" />
		</a>
	</div>
</p>
<p>Most of the panel plugins, available via the <a href="http://goodies.xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce Goodies project</a>, have been updated for the new panel, and the new <code>xfce4-xfapplet-plugin</code> allows users to add GNOME panel applets to the Xfce panel.</p>

<h2>Preferred Applications</h2>
<p>A new preferred applications framework was imported into Xfce, so users no longer need to edit shell profiles to specify which browser and terminal emulator should be used by Xfce applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 320px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
		<a href="/images/about/tour/preferred-applications.png">
			<img src="/images/about/tour/preferred-applications-thumb.png" border="0" />
		</a>
	</div>
</p>

<h2>Window Manager Tweaks</h2>
<p>Xfwm4, the Xfce window manager, saw a lot of improvements. One of the most interesting user-visible changes is the inclusion of a window manager tweaks dialog, which allows users to tweak several advanced options of the window manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	<div class="code" style="width: 320px; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">
		<a href="/images/about/tour/wmtweaks.png">
			<img src="/images/about/tour/wmtweaks-thumb.png" border="0" />
		</a>
	</div>
</p>
<p>There is also support to tweak the builtin composition manager in the window manager settings if <code>xfwm4</code> was built with support for the Xcomposite extension.</p>
