<p>Xfce provides a lightweight desktop environment with default icons and
  themes. First it is completed with a desktop manager providing icons, next
  with multiple panels for a default menu, preferred applications and extra
  plugins, and a window manager with Xorg's composite feature for transparencies
  and shadows. Moreover it suits a session manager for startup and shutdown
  functionalities, and a settings manager for global Xfce components and general
  items.</p>
<p>Xfce provides common applications, designed to be lightweight too for the
  desktop environment. These applications are: a modern terminal emulator with
  tabs, an iCal based calendar to notice events and appointments, and a mixer
  to control the volumes. Some Xfce applications comes with a panel plugin. For
  example the calendar provides a plugin to show a customizable date, and the
  mixer provides a control on the master volume.</p>
<p>Finally Xfce provides end-user applications, always designed lightweight,
  which are: a simple and fast text editor with printing feature, an easy-to-use
  file-manager, a media player based on Xine, a CD's and DVD's burner, and an
  archive manager supporting multiple compression formats.</p>
