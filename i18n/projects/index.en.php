	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfwm4">Window manager</a></h3>
	    <!-- Drop Shadows, improved compositing, shortcut editor is removed from xfwm4 -->
	    <p>The Xfce 4 window manager. It manages the placement of application windows on the screen, 
	    provides window decorations and manages workspaces or virtual desktops. Xfwm4 natively
	    supports multihead mode. It provides its own compositing manager (a manager for the Xorg Composite 
	    extension, which brings true transparency to the Xfce desktop). The themes support image
	    composition with PNG images as layers, which means that one can do gradients or anything else, 
	    and that applies to any pixmap that make the window frame. Xfwm4 includes a keyboard shorcuts editor. 
	    Moreover, users can shade windows and switch desktops using the mouse wheel.</p>

	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfce4-panel">Panel</a></h3>
	    <!-- Complete rewrite, so new text -->
	    <p>It provides both vertical and horizontal modes, a workspace switcher, a clock, an auto-hide feature, 
	    easy-to-setup detachable menus and application launchers. The panel supports transparency when the X Composite extension is enabled. It offers an easy 
	    way to add a plugin, using a dialog and mouse double-click. It's compatible with the numerous plugins 
	    available from the <a href="http://xfce-goodies.berlios.de/" target="_blank">Xfce Goodies Project</a> page.</p>

	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfdesktop">Desktop manager</a></h3>
	    <!-- Minimized icons or Launcher icons (Thunar-vfs) -->
	    <p>The desktop background manager. This program sets the background image and provides a root window menu. It 
	    includes gradient support for background color, saturation support for background image, real multiscreen 
	    and xinerama support, a desktop menu editor with DND support from xfce4-appfinder and .desktop files from Rox, 
	    Konqueror, Nautilus, Xffm... The desktop menu and the window list have optional support for icons, so you can 
	    use icons only if you want, and if your computer has enough resources to handle them. Moreover, Xfdesktop4 
	    provides a desktop menu plugin for the panel: you can get standard menu from either the panel or the desktop.</p>

	<td width="50%" valign="top">
	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfce4-session">Session manager</a></h3>
	    <!-- No big changes -->
	    <p> The session manager. The session manager controls the startup and shutdown of the Xfce Desktop Environment. On
	    logout it can save the running application and start them again the next time you log in. It's compatible with 
	    Gnome/KDE, supports multihead modes (Xinerama and multiscreen), doesn't rely on smproxy (or any rewrite like gnome-smproxy), 
	    but provides (partial) session management even for non-sm or X11R5-sm aware apps. Moreover, it supports nice themes.</p>

	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfprint4">Printing Helper</a></h3>
	    <!-- No big changes -->
	    <p>Provides a graphical frontend for printing. It includes xfprint4 and xfprint-manager. Xfprint can use either 
	    CUPS, BSD-LPR or a file as destination, and printers are retrieved from the printing system you choosed.</p>

	<td width="50%" valign="top">
	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfce-mcs-manager">Settings manager</a></h3>
	    <!-- No big changes -->
	    <p>Provides the Multi-Channel Settings, a modular, host independent, network transparent and centralized configuration 
	    system. It runs in the background and provides global settings information to other Xfce components. There is a main control 
	    panel to access the configuration dialogs of Xfce components. Its icons are customizable. The MCS plugins provide settings 
	    dialogs for general items that are not part of a package, e.g. GTK, mouse, fonts, keyboard and display settings.</p>

	    <h3><a href="/projects/xfce-utils">Utilities</a></h3>
	    <!-- New run dialog?? -->
	    <p>Essential utilities and scripts. Provides a taskbar, an &quot;about&quot; dialog, a run dialog and several important 
	    scripts that are used by other packages including the panel (startxfce4, xfhelp4, xflock4, xfmountdev4, and xfterm4). 
	    Also contains the user guide. The taskbar includes an &quot;always group tasks&quot; option, a selectable  left/center/right 
	    alignment and variable width, and a right-click action menu.</p>
