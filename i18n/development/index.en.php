<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
Xfce welcomes any kind of contribution. We need every skills, not 
only coders: translations, documentation or artwork are also very
 important and need your help!

<p>
Feel free to join us developing the next major branch of Xfce, or fix bugs in existing releases. The
<a href="http://bugzilla.xfce.org">bugzilla</a> and the <a href="">roadmap</a> are a good start to get
ideas on what needs some love.
</p>

<p>
If you need more details or want to get news about the current development, suscribe the
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev">development mailing list</a>.
The <a href="http://wiki.xfce.org/">Xfce wiki</a> also contains a lot of additionnal information.

<h3>Goodies</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://goodies.xfce.org">Xfce goodies</a> are independant projects related to the Xfce desktop, but they are not part of the
official release. They also need your help: you should contact the maintainer of the project you want to contribute to, but you can
also start your own project. The <a href="">Goodies development mailing list</a> is there for you if you have any questions.
</p>

<h3>Translations</h3>

The <a href="http://i18n.xfce.org/">Xfce i18n wiki</a> contains all instructions on how to contribute 
to the translations. If you have any questions, the

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
As you may have noticed, the <a href="/documentation/">Xfce documentation</a> needs a lot of work.
A new documentation is being worked on, if you want to join this new effort, please contact us using the
<a href="http://foo-projects.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev">development mailing list</a>.
</p> 

<h3>Artwork</h3>

<p>
We need volounteers for the <a href="/about/artwork">Xfce Artwork</a>. Design new icons, wallpapers, or Xfwm4 themes by following our 
step-by-step example <a href="http://wiki.xfce.org/howto">howto's</a>. Or you can just take a look at 
<a href="http://www.xfce-look.org/">xfce-look</a> to see how others have customized their Xfce desktop.
